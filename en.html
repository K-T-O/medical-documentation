    Tadeusz Olszewski, our dad is a 69 year old mechanical engineer. Almost all his life he spent in a mechanical
    workshop
    or renovating machineries in the mills of the food industry. He never really cared about health, in fact
    rather did not care at all.
    He mostly suffered from lung infections (`56 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis; in the`68
    <a href="olszewski_tadeusz_akademia_medyczna_gdansk_29101997_eng.pdf" target="_blank">
        `97 because of pneumonia and suspected infiltration of neo he was hospitalized
    </a>).
    At home if he was sick
    mostly from lung infections, they were characterized by continuous and long-lasting cough and a very high fever (at
    least according to cards from GP `72 -`97). In time, other infections came along mostly joint infections: sciatica
    and
    inflammations: shoulder, big toe, shin bone (likely after an injury). Dad was an avid fisherman - could stand
    in a cold water for a long time - too long.
</p><p>
    Today dad is on dialysis due to renal disease (nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria), he has been diagnosed with AA
    amyloidosis (kidney biopsy), rheumatoid arthritis, gout. There are still some diagnoses to be done, especially of
    lungs disease and connective
    tissue to find the underlying cause. He often suffers from infections and inflammation.
</p><h4>
    History
</h4><p>
    Underlying disease, as we think, began to manifest itself in 2008, with metatarsal pain and posterior tibial tendon
    in
    his
    right leg. He visited orthopedist, underwent ultrasound, blockade. Then, within half a year, the indisposition from
    other
    organs (systems) have started to display:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>stomach (reflux, inflammation of the colon)</li>
    <li>arthritis (more swelling than pain)</li>
    <li>urinary tract (proteinuria, infection)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Dad was more and more drowsy, listless. In April 2009, he went to the hospital for diagnosis:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>rheumatological: initially no signs of rheumatoid arthritis, no ankylosing spondylitis, no antinuclear</li>
    <li>Immunological: high anti-CCP section of the large intestine - nonspecific inflammatory picture, but no
        amyloidosis
        in the large intestine
    </li>
    <li>Renal: proteinuria</li>
    <li>Lung diseases (infections)</li>
</ul><p>
    Then in August 2009, in rheumatologic hospital,
    <a href="olszewski_tadeusz_gdansk_zaspa_09042009_eng.pdf" target="_blank">
        he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, gout
    </a>
    - treatment included Metypredem (sleepiness improved).
</p><p>
    Then dad tore the Achilles tendon in his right leg. (September)
</p><p>
    He went under the Nephrology care because of durable proteinuria. As a result of further assessment of proteinuria,
    nephrotic
    syndrome was found, and in March 2010 he underwent a renal biopsy - diagnosed with amyloidosis.
</p><p>
    In the meantime, in January 2010, my dad broke the second Achilles tendon (left). Due to plaster and immobilization
    in
    mid-March
    a massive thrombosis of deep veins was formed and he was taken to the hospital (USG / Emergency), there
    further complication of the disease occurred (probably due to urinary tract infections), further hospitalization was
    continued
    in a nephrology department.
</p><p>
    Dad is under the care of nephrology clinic, rheumatology clinic, pulmonary clinic and treated privately (2013
    stayed in Rheumatological hospital).
</p><p>
    In February 2014, due to deteriorating nephrological results and pulmonary infections he was taken to the hospital
    for
    observation and treatment modifications (RA, amyloidosis).
</p><p>
    In April 2014 because of an infection and high fever he was taken to the Nephrology hospital, stayed there for
    nearly a month due to inability to control the infections, kidneys have shut down, hemodialysis have started. In May
    2014 fistula has been introduced.
</p>
<p>
    In June 2014 he was
    <a href="olszewski_tadeusz_krakow_20062014_eng.pdf" target="_blank">
        thoroughly examined
    </a>
    in a Pulmonology Hospital in Krakow.
